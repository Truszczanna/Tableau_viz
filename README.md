     This dashboard point is to help student who have to move to Seattle and rent an apartment for few months.
     Questions that can be answered by this dashboard: 
     - where are the cheapest aparments?
     - what is the average price per listing in specific location?
     - does the average size of 1 or 2 bedroom aparments differ in significant way?
     - how many apartments are avaible with specific number of bedrooms?
     - does number of bedrooms affect score in significant way?
     - how does average monthly rent price look like accordingly to number of bedrooms and room type?
